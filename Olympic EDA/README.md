# 120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results

This is a historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games, including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. I scraped this data from www.sports-reference.com in May 2018. The R code I used to scrape and wrangle the data is on GitHub. I recommend checking my kernel before starting your own analysis.

Note that the Winter and Summer Games were held in the same year up until 1992. After that, they staggered them such that Winter Games occur on a four year cycle starting with 1994, then Summer in 1996, then Winter in 1998, and so on. A common mistake people make when analyzing this data is to assume that the Summer and Winter Games have always been staggered.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

1. Exploratory Data Analysis is an approach in analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods.
EDA assists Data science professionals in various ways:-

    1  Getting a better understanding of data
    2  Identifying various data patterns
    3 Getting a better understanding of the problem statement

2. Checking Introductory Details About Data
The first and foremost step of any data analysis, after loading the data file, should be about checking few introductory details like, no. Of columns, no. of rows, types of features( categorical or Numerical), data types of column entries.

3. Statistical Insight
This step should be performed for getting details about various statistical data like Mean, Standard Deviation, Median, Max Value, Min Value

4. Data cleaning
This is the most important step in EDA involving removing duplicate rows/columns, filling the void entries with values like mean/median of the data, dropping various values, removing null entries

5. Data Visualization
Data visualization is the method of converting raw data into a visual form, such as a map or graph, to make data easier for us to understand and extract useful insights.
